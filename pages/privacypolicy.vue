                <li><p>organisations  that  you  have  given  permission  to  supply  your  details  to  a  third  party  for research purposes.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>How and why CVR processes your personal data</b><br>
            The personal information we collect is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>combined with the responses/views/opinions of others who participated in the same research and reported back anonymously to the client that commissioned the study; or</p></li>
                <li><p>used on anaggregated basis to determine which groups of people think certain things more than others; or</p></li>
                <li><p>used to administer andoperate prize draws and incentives; or</p></li>
                <li><p>occasionally used to re-contact you to validate your responses (if youhave consented to us doing so).</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of your responses to questions posed within surveys, interviews or solution labs are confidential. We will never intentionally disclose your personal information or individual survey responses to the client that commissioned the study or any third parties unless:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>you request or consent to share your identifying information and individual responses; or</p></li>
                <li><p>in the rare but possible circumstance that the information is subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, orders or for similar legal or regulatory requirements.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>We also collect your personal information for one of the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>to correspond with you after you have contacted us;</p></li>
                <li><p>to invite you to participate in research;</p></li>
                <li><p>to confirm the details of the research you have agreed to take part in;</p></li>
                <li><p>to conduct research with you;</p></li>
                <li><p>to validate answers/views you gave in a recent research we conducted (if you have consented to us doing so);</p></li>
                <li><p>to update and to ensure that our records of your personal information are correct (applicable to those consenting to be part of an ongoing community or panel); and</p></li>
                <li><p>to notify you if you have won a prize draw that we administered or to provide you with an incentive for taking part.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will not mislead you about the nature of the research or how the data will be used. The information on about the nature of the research and how the data will be used is normally placed on the invitation or the consent form (or informed as sent form).</p>
            <p>If you are invited to take part in research, it will be because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>you have responded to a call-out to take part in a research project being conducted by CVR; or</p></li>

                <li><p>you were selected because you are a service-user or service-provider to one of the companies or organisations that has commissioned us; or</p></li>
                <li><p>you have given permission for a company or organisation to supply your details to a third party for research purposes; or</p></li>
                <li><p>you have taken part in previous research administered by CVR and given us your permission to contact you in the future for research purposes.</p></li>
            </ul>
